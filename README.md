# CPSC 210 PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Purpose of application + Reason for choice

This application is a **text-based adventure game** with some minor point-and-click elements. 
The GUI will be a simple screen with text and interactive elements like buttons and text 
input. The story features the player as a tourist visiting a mysterious town and discovering
the dark secret behind it. Gaming people will use this application.

In my free time, I enjoy playing games, particularly story-based ones.  Hence, I chose to 
make a game for my term project.
