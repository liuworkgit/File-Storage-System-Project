# CPSC 210 PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Purpose of application + Reason for choice

This application is a **note-taking app** which allows the user to make multiple "pages" and link between
them. The intended userbase are students and people who like to organize their notes. I myself regularly
take notes on paper, but lament the limitations, hence why I wanted to make a note-taking app.
